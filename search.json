    "text": "What are the main issues addressed in a set of documents? Are those documents similar or discussing different matters? What is the most important topic? Delineating the main themes in a collection of documents is a common task in social sciences, particularly when exploring a new corpus. Although topics can, in principle, be identified manually, doing so becomes impossible when dealing with large corpora. For this reason, social scientists have long relied on topic modelling techniques to quickly extract the main themes present in their corpus (Asmussen & Møller, 2019), whether for exploratory purposes or to assign a label to individual document to conduct further analysis (DiMaggio et al., 2013).\n\nTopic modelling is a natural language processing task that extracts latent topics structuring a corpus For instance, Jockers & Mimno (2013) extracted broad themes in the English literature from the 19th century.  Several algorithms can perform this – for many years, LDA was the method de choix, now challenged by embedding-based approaches like BERTopic.\nNatural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science that analyses textual data. Main NLP tasks are text generation (like chatGPT), text classification, or topic modelling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Topic Modelling in-out sketch\n\n\n\nUntil recently, topic modelling techniques — and natural language processing (NLP) in general — heavily relied on word counts, especially bag-of-words approaches. Amongst other limits, those approaches did not take into account the context in which a word is used — the order of the words in a sentence does not matter to those models, thus failing to grasp the complexity of the human language.\nTo tackle this limit, researchers developed approaches that generate richer and denser representations based on deep learning models. Those models take the text as an entry and generate a vector representation called embeddings. BERTopic is a topic model package written in Python that leverages embeddings generated by pre-trained transformer models1 to delineate coherent topics based on the semantic similarity of texts.\nSince its inception in 2022, BERTopic has proven its relevance in various studies. For instance, Bizel-Bizellot et al. (2024) used it to analyse survey-free-text answers and identified the main circumstances of infection with COVID-19. In a different field, Törnberg & Törnberg (2025) analysed images and texts to highlight trends regarding misinformation on climate.\nBERTopic is a useful tool, but mastering it may feel demanding. In this tutorial, we focus on the general philosophy and how to use BERTopic for a social science project. We will demonstrate how to start with a text corpus and create a topic model that makes sense. We will create a topic model of the PhD theses defended between 2010 and 2022 in France to describe what keeps French PhD students busy.\nBy the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:\n\nGet an idea of what you can do with topic modelling in social science\nSet up a topic model on your data and make sense of the results\nUnderstand each step of the BERTopic pipeline and customise it\n\nWe conclude this tutorial with a discussion on good practices for reproducibility. \nPython, Machine Learning and NLP prerequisites\nWe don’t assume that you have any knowledge about NLP and try our best to explain every step in an agnostic manner. We also provide numerous references for those who want to dig deeper.\nNevertheless, you will need to have some notions of Python. If you need to refresh your Python skills, you can use Lino Galiana’s courses. We assume that:\n\nyou have a working environment and can install packages\nyou know the basic syntax of Python (functions, variables, if-statements, for loops) and you’re comfortable enough with Pandas to load your documents and proceed to simple manipulations such as creating, dropping and renaming columns and rows.\n\nIn this tutorial, we use Python 3.12, and you can install the packages we will need with :\npip install -U bertopic pandas scikit-learn datasets plotly kaleido stopwordsiso nbformat ipykernel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe provide a detailed requirement file that should work for Linux and MacOS.\n\n\nMaterial\nThe tutorial comes with some material uploaded on Zenodo :\n\nA Jupyter notebook with code to execute\nThe original dataset (which can be downloaded here)\nA clean dataset with the cleaning code"

    "text": "The BERTopic pipeline\nThe BERTopic pipeline takes a list of text documents and returns meaningful topics as well as a mapping from the text documents to the said topics. The goal is to be able to gather documents that are semantically close into clusters, and then describe these topics for further interpretation. Once you have a set of topics, you can come back to the corpus to describe its composition.\nHere is a basic usage of BERTopic which uses the main methods :\nfrom bertopic import BERTopic\n\n# Load your documents\ndocuments = [\n    \"My cat is the cutest.\",\n    \"Offer your cat premium food.\",\n    \"The Empire State Building is 1,250 feet tall.\",\n]\n\n# Create a BERTopic object\ntopic_model = BERTopic()\n\n# Fit your model to your documents\ntopic_model.fit(documents)\n\n# Predict the topics and probabilities\ntopic, probabilities = topic_model.transform(documents)\n\n# Or do it all at once\ntopic, probabilities = topic_model.fit_transform(documents)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe methods fit, transform, and fit_transform belong to a common syntax in machine learning systematized by Scikit-learn, one of the first and most complete machine learning library in Python. A vanilla model is fitted on the data (parameters are tweaked), and then the model is used to make predictions on new data.\n\n\nThe transformation produces two outputs.\n\nThe topic variable is a list containing integers: for each document, the integer represents the topic/group it belongs to. In our case, topic = [0, 0, 1] as the first 2 documents mention cats, whereas the last document is about the Empire State Building.\nThe probabilities variable is a list of floats: for each document, the float represents how close it is to the topic.\n\nWe can then retrieve topic information that will return keywords that best represent our corpus:\ntopic_info = topic_model.get_topic_info()\nThe topic_info variable is a table like this :\n\n\n\nTable 1: Topic information for a simplified corpus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\nCount\nName\nRepresentation\nRepresentative_Docs\n\n\n\n\n0\n2\n0_cat\n“cat”\n“My cat is the cutest”\n\n\n1\n1\n1_building\n“building”\n“The Empire State Building is 1,250 feet tall”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Topic column lists the topic IDs, the Count column lists the number of element there are in each topic, the Name column is a summary of topic ID and keywords — listed in the Representation column, and finally the Representative_Docs lists example of documents that are representative of the topic.\nIn reality, this example would not run because there are not enough documents! Let’s have a look at what one can expect from BERTopic, working with a real dataset: the abstracts of all the theses defended in France since 2010. After carefully setting the parameters and verifying the topic model’s quality, we obtain the following results:\n\n\n\nTable 2: Topic information of the French theses after tuning the topic model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\nCount\nName\nRepresentation\n\n\n\n\n0\n1601\nPhysics and Applied Mathematics\nmodel study material property method phase surface field process thesis\n\n\n1\n1275\nBiology and Health Research\ncell gene protein study expression role species response involve mouse\n\n\n2\n1156\nPolitical Sciences, Law and Geography\nlaw legal study french language international teacher analysis public social\n\n\n3\n1030\nData Science\npropose datum model method base approach network thesis application algorithm\n\n\n4\n631\nHistory and History of Art\nliterary century study writing art time author history narrative period\n\n\n5\n202\nMathematics\ngraph prove study space class thesis chapter theorem random theory\n\n\n6\n328\nPsychology et Child Health\nstudy child patient infant adolescent disorder preterm social age intervention\n\n\n7\n105\nEconomy\nmonetary bank policy economic chapter financial country banking credit growth\n\n\n8\n172\nChemistry and Nanotechnologies\nemulsion hydrogel microgels casein surface collagen property droplet quercetin gel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: 2D plot of the French theses after tuning the topic model — grey dots are classified as “noise”; these elements can be reassigned a category as we will describe later."

    "text": "Breaking down the process\nUnder the hood, BERTopic does three main steps:\n\nGenerate a mathematical representation of each document that captures the semantic properties — the embeddings.\nBased on the embeddings, identify groups of documents that are semantically close (this action is called clustering). The hope is that these groups represent latent topics of the corpus.\nFor each identified topic/group, retrieve keywords that best describe the specificity of each topic.\n\n\nHow to generate the embeddings?\nTo generate the embeddings, we use encoder models. Encoder models are a type of pre-trained transformer model2 whose job is to encapsulate the semantics of textual data. A good example of an encoder is the BERT model and all its successors, like RoBERTa or DeBERTa. By default, BERTopic uses a package called sentence-bert, or SBERT, for generating embeddings.  Encoder models can take in a limited number of tokens (parts of words); this is called the context window size. For smaller models, the context window size is about 500 tokens (200 words on average), like for BERT, and larger models like ModernBERT have a context window size of 8,000 tokens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more about embedding techniques\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBERTopic documentation on embeddings\n“The illustrated Transformer” by Jay Alammar\nA visual explanation of general concepts behind LLMs by 3Blue1Brown\n\n\n\n\nThe embeddings — ie the generated vectors, contain hundreds of dimensions (for instance, the dimension of BERT’s embeddings is 512). Clustering algorithms work poorly with this many dimensions so we need to reduce the dimensionality of the embedding space (typically between 2 and 10). To reduce the dimensionality, the BERTopic pipeline uses the UMAP algorithm for its ability to grasp local and global structures (McInnes et al., 2018)3. This means that, despite moving from several hundred dimensions to only a couple, documents that are close together will stay close and distant ones will stay further apart. This is a critical step as we are heavily changing the structure of the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more about dimensionality reduction and UMAP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“What is dimensionality reduction?” by Eda Kavlakoglu (IBM)\nUMAP documentation\nYoutube videos to understand the main ideas (StatQuest) and the mathematical details (StatQuest).\nTo explore the impact of the UMAP parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to generate clusters\nThe goal for the clustering algorithm is to create groups of documents that are semantically close. We are not certain that the output clusters will be “real” topics, ie. meaningful. In fact, as it often happens with these methods, some clusters make no sense, some should be merged, other separated.  But our intention is to tune the BERTopic pipeline in order for the clusters to be representatives of topics that are latent in our corpus. \nDifferent algorithms can be used for clustering. HDBSCAN was chosen for its ability to detect clusters based on their density, hence it is able to detect clusters of various shapes and densities. HDBSCAN also allows for documents to be labelled as noise to primarily focus on dense and coherent groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more about clustering techniques and HDBSCAN\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClustering by Scikit-Learn\nPresentation of HDBSCAN by John Healy - PyData NYC 2018\nThe HDBSCAN documentation\nThe Scikit-Learn documentation of HDBSCAN\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to describe topics / retrieve keywords\nOnce we have created groups of documents, we need to create a meaningful representation of these topics. The general idea in BERTopic is to identify keywords that best describe the specificity of each topic.\nTo achieve that, it needs to come back to all the texts in the cluster and sparse them at the word level4. It uses word-count-based techniques that will count the number of occurrences of each word5. There are different strategies to make this word-count-based representation better. For instance, we can choose to remove stop-words — words that do not carry much semantic information (ex: “the”, “I”, “is”, “but”, … ). Other solutions include lemmatisation of words to consider “cats” and “cat” as one word.\nThe idea is to create a word x document matrix. The most basic strategy is to use the CountVectorizer object from scikit-learn which will create a word x document matrix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the two following documents:\n\n“My cat is the cutest.”,\n“Offer your cat premium food.”,\n\nThe word x document matrix would be:\n\n\n\n\ndoc 1\ndoc 2\n\n\n\n\ncat\n1\n1\n\n\ncutest\n1\n0\n\n\noffer\n0\n1\n\n\npremium\n0\n1\n\n\nfood\n0\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn contemporary text analysis, the word x document matrix is seldom used. A usual transformation is called TF-IDF, as it highlights words that matter most. In practice, it gives more importance to words that appear often in a document and decreases the score of words that appear in many documents. BERTopic uses an alternative option called c-TF-IDF. This transformation raises the score of words that appear often in documents of the same group and decreases the score of words appearing in other groups. With this transformation, we retrieve words that make a group unique!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more about bag-of-words and TF-IDF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“N-gram Language Models” Chapter 3 of Speech and Language Processing by D.Jurafsky and J.H.Martin\nTutorial TF-IDF with Scikit-Learn"

    "section": "Preprocess your data",
    "text": "Preprocess your data\nAs mentioned before, we will use the dataset listing all dissertations defended in France since 1985. The original dataset can be downloaded on data.gouv.fr. To avoid excessive pre-processing, we curated6 the dataset and uploaded it (with the code) on Zenodo.\nIt is crucial to stress that the preprocessing step is the most important step. Although we can tune the topic model towards meaningful clusters and representations, your corpus is your input and no model will generate good results out of poor inputs. We list a number of questions you need to consider and justify for your topic model to be relevant:\nIs my corpus homogeneous enough?\nIt could be tempting to shove millions of different documents from different sources into a topic model and see what comes out. However, to make sure that the groups will represent topics, one must be sure that your documents are similar in formality, tone, length, density of information etc… If your corpus is too heterogeneous, the topic model can highlight these differences and you will lose sight of meaningful latent topics7.\nIn our case, as we analyse dissertation abstracts which are quite standardised, the corpus should be homogenous enough for the topic model to pick up topics and not other semantic dimensions. It is worth noting that using the abstracts as a proxy to analyse a corpus of papers is common practice (Ma et al., 2025; Ollion et al., 2025)\nAre my documents in the right language?\nMost of the time, language models are trained in a single language. Some models are called multi-lingual and accept texts in more than one language. However, in our experience, working with documents in different languages generates poor topics as the language shift holds for the most salient difference and each language is clustered by itself. We recommend translating your documents in a single language beforehand.\nIn our case, the data curation led us to extract dissertations where both the English and the French abstracts were provided and we will work with abstracts in each language separately.\nHow long are my documents?\nOne needs to precisely define their task before diving into topic modelling. What are you trying to analyse? Will this information be available at the sentence level? paragraph level? the document level?\nIn our case, the topic of the dissertations will be described throughout the abstract, hence the abstract must be taken as a whole and not subdivided at the sentence level.\nAlso, as introduced before, each embedding model has a context window, meaning that long documents will be truncated. One must make sure that the length of the documents in their corpus is smaller than the model’s context window. If the context window is too small consider changing embedding model. Careful though, larger context window means longer computation time and greater computation resources required to run the model.\nWe will confirm the length of our documents before using the embedding model."

Only 5% of the rows do not have valid topics (French or English). The language of the topics has not been checked because they will only be used to check the qualitative validity of topic model.\n\nLet’s take some time to check if our documents fit inside the context window. To retrieve the context window size, you can check the HuggingFace page of the model or load the configuration file that contains this information as such:\nconfig = AutoConfig.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code = True)\nprint(f\"Context window size of the model {model_name}: {config.max_position_embeddings}\")\nLet’s look at two models, sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (default embedding model in the BERTopic pipeline) and Alibaba-NLP/gte-multilingual-base.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Context window size of the model sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2: 512\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Context window size of the model Alibaba-NLP/gte-multilingual-base: 8192\nAnd now let’s look at the length of our documents:\ndf_raw[\"resumes.en.len\"] = df_raw[\"resumes.en\"].apply(len)\ndf_raw[\"resumes.fr.len\"] = df_raw[\"resumes.fr\"].apply(len)\ndf_raw.loc[:,[\"resumes.en.len\", \"resumes.fr.len\"]].describe()\n\nDescriptive statistics of the length of the abstracts in English and in French\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nresumes.en\nresumes.fr\n\n\n\n\nmin\n1\n6\n\n\n25%\n1324\n1508\n\n\n50%\n1617\n1702\n\n\n75%\n2080\n2362\n\n\nmax\n12010\n12207\n\n\nmean\n1777\n1984\n\n\nstd\n735\n802\n\n\n\nWith these statistics, we see that we can rule out using sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 because it’s context window is too narrow. By keeping abstracts between 1000 and 4000 characters (ie between 300 and 1300 tokens8) we can retain most of the dataset (89%) while maintaining a reasonable computation time.\nvalid_index = np.logical_and.reduce([\n    df_raw[\"resumes.fr.len\"] &gt;= 1000,\n    df_raw[\"resumes.fr.len\"] &lt;= 4000,\n    df_raw[\"resumes.en.len\"] &gt;= 1000,\n    df_raw[\"resumes.en.len\"] &lt;= 4000,\n])\n\ndf = df_raw.loc[valid_index,:]\nEven if it is more interesting to process the complete dataset, it can be computationally expensive.

The code changes as such:\nlanguage = \"english\" # or \"french\"\nlanguage_short = language[:2] # \"en\" or \"fr\"\n\n# Load the embeddings directly to avoid long computation time\nds = load_from_disk(f\"./data/embeddings/gte-multilingual-base-{language_short}-SBERT\")\ndocs = np.array(ds[f\"resumes.{language_short}\"]) # 6500 rows\nembeddings = np.array(ds[\"embedding\"])           # Shape : 6500 x 768\n\nvectorizer_model = CountVectorizer(stop_words = list(stopwords(language_short)))\n\n\ntopic_model = BERTopic(\n    language = language,\n    vectorizer_model = vectorizer_model,\n)\ntopic_model.fit(documents=docs, embeddings=embeddings)\nNow to extract the topics, we need to call the transform method :\ntopics, probabilities = topic_model.transform(documents=docs, embeddings=embeddings)\nAnd to explore the topics we can call the get_topics_info method that will return a table with the keywords, representative documents and the number of documents in each topic:\ntopic_info = topic_model.get_topic_info()\ntopic_info\n\n\n\nTable 3: Topic information (truncated) of the French dissertations for a basic topic model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\nCount\nRepresentation\n\n\n\n\n0\n-1\n2715\n[‘study’, ‘thesis’, ‘model’, ‘based’, ‘analysis’, ‘data’, ‘process’, ‘approach’, ‘development’, ‘social’]\n\n\n1\n0\n262\n[‘literary’, ‘writing’, ‘art’, ‘contemporary’, ‘authors’, ‘poetry’, ‘narrative’, ‘history’, ‘texts’, ‘poetic’]\n\n\n2\n1\n172\n[‘mechanical’, ‘numerical’, ‘behavior’, ‘material’, ‘crack’, ‘model’, ‘materials’, ‘experimental’, ‘element’, ‘finite’]\n\n\n3\n2\n172\n[‘cells’, ‘cancer’, ‘tumor’, ‘cell’, ‘immune’, ‘expression’, ‘patients’, ‘melanoma’, ‘tumors’, ‘response’]\n\n\n4\n3\n155\n[‘flow’, ‘numerical’, ‘fluid’, ‘acoustic’, ‘flame’, ‘flows’, ‘model’, ‘simulations’, ‘method’, ‘experimental’]\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n102\n101\n10\n[‘influenza’, ‘vaccination’, ‘meningitis’, ‘virus’, ‘infection’, ‘pedv’, ‘nmx’, ‘h5n1’, ‘serogroup’, ‘dbs’]\n\n\n103\n102\n10\n[‘ablation’, ‘atrial’, ‘intracranial’, ‘vein’, ‘cardiac’, ‘fibrillation’, ‘icp’, ‘phantoms’, ‘catheter’, ‘veins’]\n\n\n104\n103\n10\n[‘building’, ‘ventilation’, ‘thermal’, ‘heat’, ‘cooling’, ‘wall’, ‘air’, ‘buildings’, ‘comfort’, ‘heating’]\n\n\n105\n104\n10\n[‘humins’, ‘tannins’, ‘biobased’, ‘foams’, ‘composites’, ‘tannin’, ‘biocomposites’, ‘cab’, ‘materials’, ‘lignin’]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe “Representation” column provides the keywords for each topic. We can see that the keywords retrieved for the noise cluster are very generic: “study”, “thesis”, “model”, “analysis”, “approach” and do not convey any meaningful information other than the fact that all documents are academic documents. \nFor each topic, the model identifies apparently consistent keywords :\n\n‘mechanical’, ‘numerical’, ‘model’, ‘finite’, ‘element’: this cluster may be grouping dissertations related to numerical simulation in mechanics using the finite element method.\n‘cells’, ‘cancer’, ‘tumor’, ‘immune’, ‘patients’: this cluster may be grouping dissertations related to cancer and cures.\n‘building’, ‘ventilation’, ‘heat’, ‘cooling’: this cluster may be grouping dissertations related to the thermodynamics of buildings.\n\nThis is not a proof that our model generated interesting results, for that we need to carry further investigation of each cluster. Still this is a first step towards assessing the quality of the topic model.\nIn this table we can see that almost half of the documents are classified as noise (topic -1). This is a normal behaviour of the clustering algorithm as it focuses on dense areas first. This way, the topic model creates representations that focus fewer documents to retrieve very specific keywords. The other 104 topics contain between 10 and 200 documents each, which correspond to 0.1% to 3% of the corpus.\nIt is worth noting that the more documents in a cluster, the lower the topic index is.\nIt is possible to re-assign clusters to documents clustered as noise with the reduce_outliers method, based on the documentation and the code, we recommend using the “embedding” strategy10:\ntopics_reduced = topic_model.reduce_outliers(\n    documents = docs, \n    topics = topics, \n    probabilities = probabilities, \n    embeddings = embeddings,\n    strategy=\"embeddings\" \n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThe topic model is not altered and keywords are not re-generated."

We are going to cover some of the most basic and helpful visualisations.\n\n2D plot\nThe first thing we want to visualise is the space of the embeddings reduced to 2 dimensions. This is a good start to visualise the size of your clusters and if close clusters have similar topics.\n(\n    topic_model\n    .visualize_documents(\n        docs = docs,\n        embeddings = embeddings,\n        hide_annotations = True, # better readability\n        topics = [0,1,2,3]       # Select topics to highlight\n        # height = 300, # Adjust the height of the plot\n        # width = 800 # Adjust the width of the plot \n    )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: 2D plot of the French dissertations for a basic topic model11\n\n\n\nOn this graph only displaying the 4 top topics, we can see that the cluster are large and dense. We can see that the “1_mechanical_numerical_behavior” and the “3_flow_numerical_fluid” are close, as expected whereas “0_literary_writing_art” and “2_cells_cancer_tumor” are further apart in separate directions.\n\n\nVisualise top words per topic\nThe second helpful visualisation is to illustrate the top \\(n\\) words that represent each topic and how representative they are of a given topic. It is a good way to analyse the consistency of each topic and get a sense of the documents inside a cluster.\ntopic_model.visualize_barchart(\n    n_words = 10, # Select the number of words to display per topic\n    # topics = [0,1,2,3,4], # Select specific topics to display\n    # top_n_topics = 6, # Select the first n topics to display\n    # height = 300, # Adjust the height of the plot\n    # width = 800 # Adjust the width of the plot \n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Top \\(n\\) words per topic of the French dissertations for a basic topic model\n\n\n\nTake the topic n°5, we can see keywords like “urban”, “land”, “city”, “local”, “public” and “ecological”. These keywords make sense together and we can imagine dissertations discussing urban planning at different scales and under different constraints.\n\n\nHierarchical trees\nA good way to visualise how topics interact with each other is to plot a dendogram. This plot is read from left to right, the sooner branches merge, the closer related topics are. We use the visualize_hierarchy method. The graph is very tall but we can easily focus on one subset of the tree at a time.\nfig = topic_model.visualize_hierarchy()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Hierarchical graph of the French dissertations for a basic topic model\n\n\n\nAt the very top of this graph, we can see the green branches related to laws and international law, very close to contract law. This is a sign that these three branches merge together and that we dont find legislation-related keywords anywhere else in the three."

    "text": "Tune parameters\nA diversity of parameters can be used to tune the topic model. In this section, we propose to tune the 3 most useful parameters outlined in the litterature: the embedding model, n_neighbors (UMAP) and n_components (HDBSCAN). A table can be found in the techy notes providing descriptions for other parameters.\n1. Assess the quality of the text representations (parameter tuned: embedding model)\nThe primary factor to tune is the embedding model, because it drastically impacts the results of the topic model. To check if the embedding makes sense, you can plot the 2D map after dimension reduction with UMAP (n_components=2). Then, by exploring the map, you can assess if the embedding space created placed similar documents together or not.\nAt this point you can also try different values for n_neighbors and n_components. However, be aware that the influence of UMAP parameters on the final topic model is difficult to appreciate at first glance.\nTune the granularity of the topic model (parameters tuned: n_neighbors and min_cluster_size)\nOnce you’ve chosen an embedding model, you can change the n_neighbors and min_cluster_size. Both work jointly: the lower these parameters, the smaller the grain and the more specific the topics. It is worth noting that these parameters are dependant of the size of your corpus. For a corpus of 5,000 documents, n_neighbors=300 is a large value, but for 50,000 documents it might be a medium value.\nTo change these parameters, one must explicitly declare UMAP and HDBSCAN objects and pass them on to the BERTopic model:\n# Load data and create the vectorizer model like before\nlanguage = \"english\" # or \"french\"\nlanguage_short = language[:2] # \"en\" or \"fr\"\nds = load_from_disk(f\"./data/embeddings/gte-multilingual-base-{language_short}-SBERT\")\ndocs = np.array(ds[f\"resumes.{language_short}\"]) # 6500 rows\nembeddings = np.array(ds[\"embedding\"])           # Shape : 6500 x 768\nvectorizer_model = CountVectorizer(stop_words = list(stopwords(language_short)))\n\n# create an HDBSCAN and UMAP models\nhdbscan_model = HDBSCAN(\n    min_cluster_size=50, \n    # Default parameters \n    prediction_data=True\n)\numap_model = UMAP(\n    n_neighbors = 50,\n    # Default parameters\n    metric = \"cosine\",\n    n_components = 5,\n    min_dist=0.0,\n    low_memory = False \n)\n\n# Then create the instance, fit the model and extract the topics and probabilities\ntopic_model = BERTopic(\n    language = language,\n    vectorizer_model = vectorizer_model,\n    umap_model= umap_model,\n    hdbscan_model=hdbscan_model\n)\ntopics, probabilities = topic_model.fit_transform(\n    documents=docs, \n    embeddings=embeddings\n)\nWe obtain the following results:\n\n\n\nTable 6: Topic information for a coarse grained topic model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic\nCount\nRepresentation\n\n\n\n\n-1\n1422\n[‘study’, ‘thesis’, ‘model’, ‘based’, ‘data’, ‘analysis’, ‘method’, ‘process’, ‘approach’, ‘developed’]\n\n\n0\n1399\n[‘law’, ‘study’, ‘political’, ‘social’, ‘thesis’, ‘public’, ‘legal’, ‘analysis’, ‘economic’, ‘international’]\n\n\n1\n1339\n[‘properties’, ‘model’, ‘study’, ‘materials’, ‘experimental’, ‘temperature’, ‘thesis’, ‘method’, ‘studied’, ‘based’]\n\n\n2\n1329\n[‘cells’, ‘cell’, ‘expression’, ‘study’, ‘role’, ‘protein’, ‘species’, ‘model’, ‘activity’, ‘involved’]\n\n\n3\n706\n[‘data’, ‘thesis’, ‘systems’, ‘propose’, ‘based’, ‘model’, ‘proposed’, ‘approach’, ‘network’, ‘methods’]\n\n\n4\n305\n[‘language’, ‘teachers’, ‘study’, ‘education’, ‘students’, ‘french’, ‘school’, ‘teaching’, ‘analysis’, ‘social’]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: 2D map for a coarse grained topic model"

These use cases require vastly different evaluation metrics to be used.\n\nThere are two types of metrics that you could use:\n\nCluster metrics — ie focus on the group-making. There exist a lot of metrics, but few are fit to our situation: unsupervised learning with density based algorithms. In our experience, optimising these metrics results in a sub-optimal solutions as illustrated bellow. Read more\nTopic representation metrics — ie focus on how relevant the keywords are. Although some metrics exist their utility is limited: good score does not necessarily align with what expert consider good topic models, and they are not good scores to optimise (Stammbach et al., 2023).

    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nthe name “transformer models” refers to a specific neural netword designed popularised by Vaswani et al. (2017), most if not all current Language models rely on this architecture.↩︎\n“Pre-Trained” means that the model has already been trained on millions of documents. “Transformer” is the name of a neural network architecture broadly used in machine learning.↩︎\nThe UMAP algorithm is very close to the t-SNE algorithm with better scaling capabilities. Another good option for the dimensionality reduction step is the PCA algorithm that will focus on the global structure. PCA is a better choice if you solely focus on the big picture (McInnes et al., 2018, p45).↩︎\nPreviously, the transformer model worked at the token level.↩︎\nTo be accurate, we count for n-grams: n-grams are sequences of textual entities (tokens or words). In the context of topic modelling, 1-grams would be words, 2-grams would be sequences of 2 words and so on.↩︎\nCuration can be found here↩︎\nDisclaimer: You may want to highlight these dimensions to identify hate speech, for instance. Homogeneity has to be relevant to your use case and questioning your corpus is a part of the topic modelling pipeline that should not remain overlooked.↩︎\nAs a rule of thumb, 1 token = 3 characters↩︎\nMore information on stratification in Pandas↩︎\nSee techy-notes for more information.↩︎\nThe space represented is not necessarily the space used during the clustering step. UMAP(n_dimensions = 2) is run on the embeddings when plotting. Also, because UMAP is non-deterministic, the result may differ from a run to another. This explains why some dots seem far away from their cluster.↩︎\nCosine similarity is a metric bound between 0 and 1 and is a proxy for the semantic distance between two words.↩︎\nThere is a small difference in the computation of the graph and the reduce outlier that we do not clearly understand. See Discussion #2453.↩︎\nWe have seven topics because we asked the topic model to reduce the number of topics to seven.↩︎\nSee techy notes for more information on what’s saved and the size of the files.↩︎\nDisclaimer: You may want to highlight these dimensions to identify hate speech, for instance. Homogeneity has to be relevant to your use case and questioning your corpus is a part of the topic modelling pipeline that should not remain overlooked.↩︎\nWe have not found resources to do so.↩︎\nThe cited paper addresses topic models’ limitations in general but use BoW techniques as a starting point for their analysis (namely LSI, LSA, NMF and LDA).↩︎"
