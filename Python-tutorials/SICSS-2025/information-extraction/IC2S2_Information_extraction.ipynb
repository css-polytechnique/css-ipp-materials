        "In previous tutorials, we covered how generative AI can help social scientists in labelling a large amount of documents. In this tutorial, we focus on another Natural Language Processing (NLP) task: Information Extraction (IE). Based on the work of Oscar Stuhler et al. (2025), we introduce the key concepts and limits so that you can make the most of this tool. \n",

        "# The Information Extraction Task\n",
        "The task \"Information Extraction\" covers numerous methods attempting at retrieving information from unstructured textual data. Methods include Named Entity Recognition (NER) or relation extraction. These methods are broadly used in research, but, to this day, few social science research projects have used these automated tools. \n",
        "\n",
        "Nevertheless, sociologists have developed their own forms to complete similar tasks. For instance, in the 1990s, Franzosi (1989) had conceptualised a \"subject-action-object triplet\" to extract information from newspapers. In the 2010s, some research projects used syntax-based parsers to speed up their analyses. For instance, Goldenstein and Poschmann retrieved subject-verb-object triplets from companies to study corporate responsibility discourse. However useful, syntax-based parsers need rigid assumptions regarding the information parsed, making it difficult to observe shifts or boundaries of established categories. For more examples, [see the article (p. 4-5)](https://osf.io/wjvfq_v1).\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the main advantages of using genAI for IE tasks is, indeed, its flexibility. Until now, researchers had developed highly specific tools that did not generalise to new contexts. Prompt-based IE mitigates this limit; however, to correctly use such tools, one needs to rigorously define the information they want to extract.\n",
        "\n",
        "# The limits of using generative AI for IE \n",
        "\n",
        "One of the major drawbacks of using genAI for IE is the non-randomness of errors. Indeed, generative LLMs are known for learning patterns learned from their training data and reproducing biases. Working with potentially biased predictions can raise serious issues for downstream analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, using genAI for research is not without problems. Even today, decoder models’ performance is highly task-dependent (see table in Ollion et al., 2023). Also, relying on proprietary models hinders project reproducibility and results stability (Barrie et al., 2025).\n",
        "\n",
        "Likewise, data protection (privacy and copyright) needs to be taken into account, especially if you are sending content to a third party, using an API or an interface. \n",
        "\n",
        "Last but certainly not least, environmental impacts need to be seriously considered before using these tools (Luccioni, 2024). \n",
        "\n",
        "# Information Extraction in practice\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, we show how to use the `openai` Python library to analyse obituaries to retrieve the gender of a deceased person and the educational institution they attended.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Environment setup\n",

He was 82 years old.\\n\\nBorn on May 3, 1942, in Providence, Rhode Island, John showed an early interest in the intricacies of science. Raised in the same city where he was born, he attended Bowdoin College, where he excelled in his studies, ultimately obtaining a college diploma.\\n\\nDeer's career as a forensic scientist was marked by his unwavering commitment to seeking justice through evidence-based investigations. His keen attention to detail and analytical skills helped solve numerous complex cases, earning him a reputation as a pioneer in his field. One of his notable contributions was the development of a new DNA analysis technique that revolutionized forensic procedures.\\n\\nDuring his time in Vietnam, where he served in the military, John Deer demonstrated courage and dedication to his duties, receiving commendations for his service. His experiences in the field further honed his investigative skills, shaping his future endeavors.\\n\\nDespite his professional achievements, John was a humble and kind-hearted individual, known for his wit and sense of humor. He had a passion for woodworking and often spent his free time creating intricate pieces of furniture for his loved ones. His meticulous craftsmanship and attention to detail were evident in every piece he crafted, reflecting his precise and methodical nature.\\n\\nIn his personal life, John was a devoted stepfather to his stepdaughter, Sarah, whom he cherished as his own. Although he did not have any biological children, he formed deep and meaningful bonds with his extended family and friends, who remember him fondly for his warmth and generosity.\\n\\nJohn Deer's sudden passing due to complications of a stroke has left a void in the forensic science community and among those who knew him. His legacy of integrity, professionalism, and dedication to his work will continue to inspire future generations of forensic scientists.\\n\\nIn remembrance of John, his colleagues and loved ones recall the countless times he shared his expertise with aspiring young scientists and mentored them with patience and encouragement. His commitment to excellence and his willingness to guide others in their professional journeys made him a beloved figure in the forensic science community.\\n\\nAs we bid farewell to John Deer, we celebrate a life well-lived, rich with accomplishments and milestones that have left an indelible mark on the field of forensic science. He will be deeply missed by all who had the privilege of knowing him, but his legacy will endure through the continued impact of his work and the lives he touched.\"}]"

        "In this tutorial, we explained how to leverage generative LLMs to rapidly retrieve information in a text. This technique is particularly interesting if you possess large amounts of unstructured textual data and want to retrieve specific pieces of information. Using genAI does not relieve researchers from the conceptualisation work of defining the information to extract and the relevance for their work.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you want to use IE in your research project, you might want to consider trying different models, to find one that best suits your needs. The paper highlights that the Llama 70B did a good job at extracting explicit information such as the gender, the age, or the cause of death, but struggled with more complex information such as the education level or the origin.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another important aspect that needs reflection is the crafting of the prompt. Some techniques, like chain-of-thoughts, can significantly improve the accuracy of the IE.\n",
        "\n",
        "Also, some tasks, like retrieving information conveyed through regular expressions, such as the age or gender, one might want to consider simpler methods or parsers with equal performance. Again, each use case needs to be carefully considered and conceptualised before making use of resource-intensive generative AI.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, they urge anyone to carefully validate their results before moving on to further analysis. "
